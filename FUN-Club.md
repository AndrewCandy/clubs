# FUN Club
*Last modified 2016-10-03*

##Purpose

To provide a setting for Olin students to view, discuss, and to make Films at Olin COllege. Fun meets every week at 1-3pm on Mondays. Every week has a various meeting times depending on the various projects' schedules. 

##Membership

Membership is semi casual. Any one can join, however they need to join specific projects. This means that once a project has started it is difficult for new members to join, unless a particular skill is needed. 

##Officers and Roles

The head of Fun known as "Producer." The Producer ultimately decides what is being made and by who. There is a secondary role "The Director" who helps the producer's dreams come true. 

##Transition Protocol

In April, the Producer will send an email to the leaders of the various Director's and their projects to discuss the trasition. People will declare a new "Producer" and various other "directors"

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The only FILM purchases are in snacks and drinks for the weekly filming events. These snacks are usually bought weekly to match filming schedules. Filming occurs at least once a week (depending on projects). Food will need to be bought for apporximately 30 people. 

##Events and Activities
People will work on films and develop strories. This club is built to make people better film makers and to give them the space to be professional as possible. We are trying to build a community of filmmakers at Olin. There will be a final screening event at the end of the semester, where people can view the films. 

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment is approved by the Director, the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.
