# How to amend your charter
So you have a charter here that you want to be able to change? Do the following:

1. Branch the current repository
2. Make the changes to your charter and commit them to that branch
3. Submit a pull request from that branch to master. You can send this pull request to members of your club to get it officially approved before the amendment takes place, if you want.
4. A CCO person will ask on the pull request if it's been approved by the proper procedures.
5. If yes, they'll merge the branch.

It's that easy!
