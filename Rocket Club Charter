**Olin Rocket Club Charter**

**Purpose**
The goal of the rocket club is to create and improve on all parts of a student designed
rocket/payload project.

**Membership**
To become a member, any student may interview into a specific subsystem team. The
club will provide information on those subsystems to potential new members.

**Officers**
The club is divided into different subsystems required for rocket design. As of 2/2/19 the
subsystems are: Avionics, Structures and Recovery, Engines, and Chemistry. The
Subsystems are headed by subsystem leads who are advised and guided by the
Systems Engineer. The Project Manager is in charge of the Systems Engineer and the
club’s health and administrative standing in general. The Project Manager is the primary
contact for the club (aka president).

**Transition Protocol**
The club shall go through voting procedure before the end of the final assessments
period of the Spring semester. For the following procedure it is assumed that all
graduating seniors are unavailable for election (because they will be gone).
*Subsystem Leads Election Process*
Members of the subsystems will vote to elevate one of their own to the position of
subsystem lead for their particular subsystem (e.g. Avionics will chose an Avionics lead
for the next year). The person elected to be subsystem lead can be vetoed however by
an agreement between the current Project Manager and Systems Engineer. This can be
overturned with a unanimous vote by all current subsystem leads.
*Project Manager and Systems Engineer Election Process*
All current subsystem leads, the current Project Manager, and the current Systems
Engineer may nominate any one member of the club to the position of Project Manager
and Systems Engineer respectively. These same people then vote on the nominees
(pending the nominee accepts the nomination).

**Club Materials, Purchases, and Space**
The club shall use the tools/facilities of the college at all available opportunities. That
being said, we are building a rocket which requires the majority of the funds the club will
request. For storage, we are using AC 426.


**Events and Activities**
The club shall meet as a whole at the discretion of the Project Manager. Subsystems
Teams will be expected to meet more regularly, separately to work on their respective
systems. Subsystem Leads, the Systems Engineer, and the Project Manager will meet
weekly to discuss overall strategy.

**Amendment Procedure**
Amendments may be proposed by the Subsystem Leads, System Engineer, and Project
Manager at the weekly strategy meeting. Upon a proposition a vote will take place
involving the Leads, SysE, and Project Manager. The amendment is passed with a
simple majority vote.

**Safety**
The club’s safety manual shall be the ultimate authority on machining, chemistry, and
launch operations. It too, like this document, shall go through the amendment
procedures outlined above. Any person, both in the club and out of the club, shall be
able to request and receive the current edition of the safety manual promptly.
