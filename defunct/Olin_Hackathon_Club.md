# Olin Hackathon Club
*Last modified Aug 13 2017*
## Purpose
To encourage, support, and provide a community for Oliners interested in attending hackathons. Along with attending events, the club will meet weekly to plan competing at/volunteering at events and to teach/learn skills that will prove useful both at hackathons and in their careers.
## Membership
Any student even vaguely interested in attending a hackathon is welcome to join. Those who are on the hackathon email list are welcome to continue using that resource if that is a medium they prefer, but they are welcome to join our group. Actual teams for events can be planned independently or through the club based on each situation.
## Officers and Roles
The club will have (four)? officers who are in charge of planning all meetings, sending out emails, and organizing all logistics. The reason to have more than one officer is to ensure that each hackathon attended by hackathon club members has an Olin point of contact there, as with more leaders it is more likely at least one will be able to attend.
## Transition Protocol
At the end of each school year, the club should reflect on whether or not the current leadership structure has been effective - if it is, keep it in place, and if it is not, discuss and implement a new way of running the club. In general, however, if a leader resigns they should designate someone to replace them, and at least one club leader should not be a senior to ensure longevity. 
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club needs no materials for now, but it will request funding for transportation to events within reasonable cost (most events will likely be far away enough that transportation is a financial concern, but not so far away that it is a huge expense for the school). As for space, informal planning meetings will probably occur in the campus center or dorm lounges, and learning/teaching sessions may require the reservation of a classroom.
## Events and Activities
Attending hackathons in the area, volunteering at hackathons, teaching each other hackathon skills such as how to use various software libraries or how to eat the most pizza in the shortest amount of time.
## Amendment Procedure
Any member can propose an amendment at any point - if over half the club agrees that a change is needed, that change will be implemented.
