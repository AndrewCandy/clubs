# Danger, Adventure, Nerds, and Knitting Club (DANK)
*Last modified 2015-10-23*


## Purpose
The goal of knitting club is to encourage knitting. Many people at Olin enjoy knitting. Many people at Olin could potentially enjoy knitting if introduced to it. Many people don’t enjoy knitting, but they won’t be part of the club. We will provide teaching and instruction for the first two groups mentioned above. 

## Membership
Anyone who wants to join knitting club is welcome. They just have to knit things and be on the mailing list.

## Officers and Roles
The CEO manages the mailing list and has control over the direction of the club, and with the other leadership (2 CKO’s -- that’s Chief Knitting Officers), has the final say on all club decisions.

## Transition Protocol
By the end of April, the officers of knitting club will pick a new leadership team for next year. At that time, the new heads of knitting club will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has occurred. A transition document will be handed down describing the illustrious history of the club and the responsibilities required to forward the organization.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Knitting club currently has a variety of knitting supplies (yarn, needles, etc.) from previous years. These were stored in the lounge cabinets in East Hall, and with approval, they would probably stay there for the rest of this academic year. Over the course of the semester, we may need to buy additional supplies as needed, and we will make purchase requests for these new knitting supplies.

## Events and Activities
We may host small knitting gatherings where people knit together. We would likely buy snacks for these events, but our other knitting supplies should cover other materials (for the actual knitting)

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time by knitting club members. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be submitted via pull request to the club charters github.
