# FORUM
*Last modified 2016-09-16*

## Purpose
Create a space to have weekly discussions, chill time, and informal learning in the Library. Each week will be of a different structure, but all are based around the principle of this weekly gathering to exchange ideas and information.

## Membership
Anyone is free to come to Forum, and there isn't any formal membership to participate. Show up and enjoy!

## Officers and Roles
A couple of people each semester will lead Forum, which entails:
  1. Coordinating with Jeff and the Library Staff
  2. Setting up and cleaning up
  3. Publicizing 

## Transition Protocol
Towards the end of each semester, the current organizers will recruit or delegate responsibility as needed. The commitment to organizing is quite informal, so as long as there are a couple of point people, all will be fine.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We generally use the Library, and may purchase snacks to provide to attendees. 

## Events and Activities
As mentioned above, weekly events will be held of all different types. For some examples, we've held:
  * BS Lecture Series
  * Podcasts and Interesting Listening with Rosy
  * Diversity discussions
  * Engineering and ethics discussions
  * Anything that shares or enriches perspectives, or provides a space for discussing a variety of topics. 

## Amendment Procedure
The semesterly coordinators can change this charter as necessary, following a discussion of some sorts. Any member of the community can bring up discussion points or proposed improvements to Forum as they see fit.
