#GO Bikes!
*Last modified 2015-09-30*

## Purpose
The purpose of the GO Bikes organization is to maintain the quality of GO bikes for communal Olin student rental in the EH bike room (following an honor code policy to make sure GO bikes return safely and users will notify the team of necessary repairs). The repair team will meet weekly and commit at least 2-3 hours per session to help build/obtain new bikes, repair/replace parts on existing bikes, and take care of club logistics as necessary.

## Membership
This organization is open to any Olin student with an interest in bike repair and builds; we'll teach you what you need to know to tinker with the bicycles. Members should be able to meet weekly in the EH bike room - an iCal will be sent after figuring out the best time for everyone's schedules. Recruitment can happen during club fair, referral by a current member, or contact with the team (show up to the weekly builds and talk to us).

## Officers and Roles
The president will delegate tasks, schedule meetings, receive and respond to feedback from Olin student body, and manage club/organization responsibilities. The lead bike mechanic will be in charge of repairs, determine/approve parts to be ordered, train new members, and manage other tinkering responsibilities. Team members will assist in repairs and actively participate in relevant club discussions/events (i.e. proposed amendments, weekly builds, Build Day, reporting bike system issues, etc).

## Transition Protocol
At the end of the school year (most likely during or after the Build Day event), the team will decide a successor based on interest to continue next year and whether or not members will still be on campus. 

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
GO bikes will continue to meet and work in the designated area in the EH bike room. Materials of interest include repair tools (stored in GO bike corner of EH bike room), replacement parts for existing bikes, and new bikes. Organization members will regularly check the GO bike inventory, order new parts if appropriate, and then submit funding requests. 

## Events and Activities
GO bikes will participate in club faires (at the beginning of Fall semester, during Candidates' Weekend, etc) to promote a healthy bike culture on campus. Build Day events are also optimal times for successful and productive GO bike work. More events to be determined by the team.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments may be proposed at any time; given that the amendment is discussed with a majority of members before submitting. If the amendment receives enough* support/approval, the revised charter will be sent to the SAC chair. *"enough" to be determined by team once it reaches full size for this semester.
