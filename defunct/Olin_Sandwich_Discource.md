# Olin Sandwich Discourse Club 
*Last modified Sept 3 2017*
## Purpose
To discuss important matters in the Olin community pertaining to the rigorous definition of sandwich and related concepts.
## Membership
Any student who (clearly) understands the definition of a sandwich or is interested in learning more is more than welcome to join.
## Officers and Roles (Bread Rolls)
There are two toastmasters who run the club, but any member who has a topic to propose is welcome to run a meeting.
## Transition Protocol
The toastmasters should designate replacements at the end of the academic year if they are a senior or if change is necessary.
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club may provide “sandwiches” at some events, and may require funding or request contributions from members depending on sandwich demand. It would be ideal to meet in a classroom where eating is allowed, though a lounge will do.
## Events and Activities
Meet regularly to discuss sandwiches. 
## Amendment Procedure
Any member can propose an amendment at any point - if over half the club agrees that a change is needed, that change will be implemented as soon as possible.
