## Purpose
Olin Aero is an organisation that seeks to enable students to develop their understanding of, and passion for Aerial systems. 

## Membership 
Membership is open to anyone. Those seeking to lead projects must propose a timeline to Aero leadership, and make a genuine effort to follow it. They will also be responsible for anyone on their subteam.

## Officers and Roles
Aero will begin this year with a President, who is in charge of the mailing list and finances. Aero seeks to expand its executive team to 5 members by Spring semester. This team will be served by Aero members that best represent existing Aero projects, and responsibilities will be shared among the 5 members.

## Transition Protocol
Initial appointments to the executive team will be made by the existing club President. Once the executive team has been implemented, the responsibility for appointing new members shall fall to them. 

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Club materials are currently stored in the RoboLab with permission of Prof. Dave Barrett. Aero will seek to acquire LPB space as the amount of space needed for projects increases this year. Expenditure for this year will include Materials for aerial vehicles, fees for competition participation, and potentially travel to said competitions.

## Events and Activities
Aero will hold weekly all hands meetings where all members will share progress on their projects. Subteam leaders will be responsible for setting their own meeting and work times to best accomodate their team members.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a majority vote from the executive team, the charter will be amended, and the resided version will be sent to the SAC clubs and Orgs chair.
