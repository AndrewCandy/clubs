*Last modified 2017-09-05*

## Purpose

Provide an outlet for the Olin community to express themselves, socialize, and improve physical fitness through dance.

## Membership

The Olin Dance Project has a very open membership, we invite the entire Olin community to come out to dance at various dance events throughout the week, whether they are on or off campus.

## Officers and Roles
The president and vice-president are responsible for organizing dance events, including coordinating with any dance group from other campuses, transportation to and from off-site dance events, etc.

## Transition Protocol

President and Vice-President positions will become free when the person holding the position graduates or leaves Olin for study away/leave of absence. If the president leaves/graduates, the vice-president becomes president and picks the vice-president. If the vice-president leaves/graduates, the president picks the new vice-president. In the event that both the president and vice-president leave, they should pick their replacements prior to leaving.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The Olin Dance Project utilizes the dance floor, which is mainly set up on the third floor of the Academic Center on the side closest to Milas Hall.

## Events and Activities

The Olin Dance Project will hold weekly blues dances, preceeded by lessons for beginners. These dances will be open to all Olin students as well as participants of the BOW Ballroom dance club. On occasion, the Olin Dance Project will hold other types of lessons and dance socials. All of the additional lessons will be open to Olin students and participants of the BOW Ballroom dance club. The socials will be open to members of the BOW community.

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments can be proposed by anyone, but require the president's and vice-president's approval before submitting to CCO for official approval.
