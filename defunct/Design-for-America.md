# BOW DFA Chapter
*Last modified 2015-07-31*

## Purpose
Design for America is a collaborative club between Babson, Olin, and Wellesley whose mission is to use human-centered design to solve local social challenges. Students will work in teams on short-term projects that do good. There will be lots of flexibility regarding the work itself, and this is a great opportunity for engineers, business students, and those interested in design to work together and do something exciting that benefits others. It is also a great way to create a portfolio - anything from coding to creating logos can be part of your project. 
## Membership
Open to all - in the first few meetings we will discuss possible ideas and group students together based on interests. We plan to have weekly meetings or check-ins and the location will most likely change between the 3 campuses. Everyone on our mailing list is a member. 
## Officers and Roles
We plan to have two students from each school to be the points of contact for all members, and each small group of students will have a team leader, but everyone who joins this club will have a strong voice and ability to impact the future of this club beyond their personal project.
## Transition Protocol
Halfway through the Spring semester, the current said two students from each school will pass their baton down to two new members that will be elected by all club members. The former two students will give them sufficient information about their new role and how to best fill it. 
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We will need a weekly meeting space - every three weeks at Olin unless the group decides otherwise - and may ask for funding in the future. To start off, we don't need any yet, but we will let you know! Thank you for giving us this option. 
## Events and Activities
At the end of each semester we will have a meeting to celebrate everyone's accomplishments and what everyone has learned - cake included! Perhaps we will need funding for said cake. The activities themselves will differ based on the group and once we're all set up we'd be more than happy to provide you with more specific information. 
## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the CCO Director.
