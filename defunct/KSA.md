## Transition Protocol
Transition of the leadership will occur during the middle of Spring semester. Members will gather and discuss in orderly fashion who will update club information and take leadership. If multiple members desire to take leadership, leadership roles may be divided based on responsibility (eg. Event organizing, tracking spending).

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Spaces
For traditional Korean Holidays, our club may use the kitchen in either EH or WH to prepare and consume food. Purchases will mostly be of ingredients for such events. Purchases will scale linearly with the number of members.

## Amendment Procedure
KSA welcomes any concerns in terms of rules and organization structure. Concerns can be voiced both publicly in meetings, or through email or private message. If required (after asking members early in the academic year) a messaging system catered for anonymity will be put in place.
