# Earth and Table
*Last modified 2015-05-19*

## Purpose
The goal of this club is to help educate the members about food-related sustainability issues while experimenting with food preparation from earth to table.

## Membership
There is an open membership policy, with a goal of connecting people who love food and are concerned about the environment. 

## Officers and Roles
The Mother Earth will serve as the executive head of the club. Members (known as Microbes) can suggest ideas for events and activities, and aid the Mother Earth in preparing for those events.
## Transition Protocol
Microbes can vote for a new Mother Earth at any time.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Cooking related events will be held in the EH or WH kitchen. Some outdoor gardening will be held outdoors. We will need some storage space which can be as simple as a blue bin in a closet somewhere. We will need to make some initial purchases for supplies such as canning jars, seed, and food stuffs. We will submit funding requests before events in order to purchase necessary materials for the events.

## Events and Activities
We will hold events ranging from garden planting, to kombucha brewing, yogurt making, as well as anything else suggested by club members. We will hold discussions during each event about the sustainability of food. 

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment meets a favorable response it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.
