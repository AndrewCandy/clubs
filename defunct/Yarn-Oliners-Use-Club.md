# Yarn Oliners Use (YOU)
*Last modified 2016-11-12*


## Purpose
The goal of YOU club is to encourage knitting, crocheting, and generally playing with yarn. Many people at Olin enjoy knitting. Many people at Olin could potentially enjoy knitting if introduced to it. Many people don’t enjoy knitting, but they won’t be part of the club. We will provide teaching and instruction for the first two groups mentioned above. Crocheting counts, as does pretty much any activity using yarn and needles.

## Membership
Anyone who wants to join YOU club is welcome. They just have to do yarn things and be on the mailing list.

## Officers and Roles
The YarnMaster manages everything, so no one else has to bother to. They take care of the mailing list, makes all final decisions for the club, makes purchase requests, and generally attempt to give yarncraft a legitimate club again.

## Transition Protocol
By the end of April, the YarnMaster will either stay the YarnMaster, pass down the exclusive YarnMaster position, or completely rework the officer positions. In any case, any new leader(s) will fill out any needed paperwork and be bestowed the responsibilities required to keep the club undead.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
YOU club currently has a variety of yarncraft supplies (yarn, needles, etc.) from previous years. These are stored in the lounge cabinets in East Hall, and they’ll stay there until someone explicitly complains. Over the course of the semester, we may need to buy additional supplies as needed, and we will make purchase requests for these new supplies.

## Events and Activities
We may host small gatherings where people yarn together and teach others yarncrafts. We might buy snacks for these events, but our supplies should cover the actual yarncraft materials.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time by YOU club members, or passed directly by the YarnMaster. In cases of membership proposition and consensus, or arbitrary YarnMaster decision, the amendment passes and the revised charter will be submitted via pull request to the club charters github.
