# Badminton Club	
*Last Updated 2014-09-12*

##Purpose
The goal of Badminton club is to provide an environment in which people interested in badminton can come together, play together, and foster their shared passion. We plan to meet weekly, and go to either the Babson Gym and set up a court at PepsiCo, or become members of the Magnus Badminton Club(only 7 minutes away from Olin) to play with other professional players. We need to coordinate with Babson as well as Magnus Club.	

##Membership
Any member can be a part of Badminton club to play in Babson. However, repeated professional playing at Magnus center will require a Magnus club membership (smaller subgroup of badminton club). Exact fees havenâ€™t been calculated yet, but will be prorated per event to be less than 20 dollars per person.	

##Officers and Roles:
A president and vice president of Magnus Club work together to contact Babson as well as Magnus Club to coordinate playing times. We then relay this information back to members of the club to go over at specified weekly times. This year, Shrinidhi Thirumalai is fulfilling the president role while Brendan Caporaletti fulfills the vice president role.	

##Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the president and vice president hold a meeting to discuss and  designate successors, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new president will inform the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair that the transition has occurred.	

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Most of the important materials we need is taken care of by Babson and Magnus Club(their courts). Most players have their own racquets, and we already have birdies. A couple extra cheap stock racquets may be needed for new and casual members to make use of. A check-out system probably will not be needed: people can just keep the racquets in the ball room and responsibly put them back at the end of an event during club outings. We will submit funding requests if we need to restock. Each person may need an event fund of less than or about 20 dollars to use a court at Badminton Magnus Club.	

##Events and Activities
We plan to have weekly events, either at Babson PepsiCo or Magnus Club, during which a group of us walk or bike over to the locations in order to play badminton for an hour or two. Once contacting the respective organizations, we can give you more information.	

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.
