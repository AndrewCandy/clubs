# Swim Club

## Purpose
To provide Olin students support and encouragement about swimming. There are no official club-wide meetings, but the club provides a platform for students to meet to go swim or discuss swimming. There may be trips to open-water swim sites, competitions for distance or speed, or other club events depending on interest.
## Membership
Membership will be defined as all members of the swimming mailing list, though all members of the Olin community are welcome to attend swimming excursions.
## Officers and Roles
The head of the swim club will be known as the swim club president. Other members that wish to be on the leadership team can do so by requesting to be made a mailing list moderator, and all members are encouraged to schedule group swims.
## Transition Protocol
In April, the swim club president will send an email to the swimming list to request applications for the next president. Once the president has designated a successor, the new president will inform the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair that the transition has occurred.
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The swim club may hold friendly competitions with a small prize going to the winner, or may purchase Olin branded swim caps. Other purchases are TBD. The swim club will primarily swim at the Babson gym, but may also do dryland training or take an open-water swim.
## Events and Activities
Swim club members will meet as often as they like to swim or work out together, and will use the mailing list as a forum of discussion about things related to swimming.
## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment is approved by the swim club president, the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.
