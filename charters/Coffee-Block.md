# Coffee Block 
_Last modified 2018-5-8_

## Purpose
The purpose of the cofee block club is to develop, promote, and apply (to Olin among other places) the "coffee block" model of community service popups. The coffee block project intends to create an open model for creating spreadable popups. It was started by Alison Palmer, Bogdan Vitoc, Leon Santen, Josh Deng, and William Fairman during P&M Spring 2018. See (https://coffeeblock.org) for more details.

## Membership
Membership is open to anyone showing passion and dedication to the mission. A collaborative, respectful, and thoughtful attitude is expected of all members.

## Officers and Roles
The goal is for coffee block to become a decentralized entity, leaving the ownership of its founders and of the Olin community. The club should reflect this by eventually having no set-in-stone leaders. However until we refine our decentralized model, it will be useful for the founding members to start with a fair amount of authority.

## Transition Protocol
As the leadership structure is not entirely determined, the continued survival of the club will simply depend on there existing a critical mass of passionate individuals on campus. If such a mass were to cease existing, the club will too -- for a club like this such things are natural and should not cause trepidation.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
The club will spend money on items essential to running popups and developing its open source "kit". Public spaces on campus will be used for meetings. The spaces for popups will be coordinated with Facilities and other pertinent parties (we already have several good precedents of this).

## Events and Activies
Meetings, popups, community outreach, collaborative design sessions.

## Amendment Procedure
If things don't work we'll change our structure. Anyone who wants to particpate in a constructive discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.
