#Aerial Competitive Racing at Olin (ACRO)
*Last modified 2016-06-17*

##Purpose
We like things that fly and people who fly them. We want to teach the skills of flying, the knowledge of unmanned aircraft function, and spread the joy of flying!

##Membership
Membership is open to all who are interested! We welcome anyone of any background and experience level.

##Officers and Roles
President: during our start-up period, we'll start with one officer, who will organize and delegate responsibilities as they see fit. 

##Transition Protocol
A president cannot be the sole president while in their last semester. A new president must be inaugurated entering this final semester to ensure that knowledge is transferred and not lost. 

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We will be using materials already belonging to the Robotics Lab as well as purchasing new equipment, which will belong to the club primarily and secondarily to the Robotics Lab (in case of the clubs dissolution). 
We will be using space within the Robotics Lab in coordination with the supervising faculty (Drew and Dave).

##Events and Activities
We will be practicing on simulation software frequently, practicing outdoors when possible, and attending local races run by MultiGP and other organizations throughout the year. These races generally have small costs of attendance, which will be factored into our budget.

##Amendment Procedure
The charter can be changed at any time with a reasonable consensus of active members.
