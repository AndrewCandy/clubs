# Cultural Conversations
## Purpose
The goal of Cultural Conversations is increase campus awareness and organic discussion around ethnic and cultural diversity at Olin.  We meet monthly and spend an hour considering and discussing a culturally related topic.
## Membership 
Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in the events! The invitation extends to Olin students, friends on other campuses, faculty/staff, etc.
## Officers and Roles
The "navigators" of Cultural Conversations will have duties such as sending announcements/iCals for the monthly events, compiling conversation-worthy resources (articles, videos, etc), absorbing feedback about the events, reflecting on the goals/impact of the club, and other logistics. 
## Transition Protocol
Navigators will be decided on a semesterly basis by the previous navigation team.

Anyone is welcome to join the navigation team at any point in the semester, officially or unofficially (i.e. perhaps a student is excited to host one particular event and will consult the navigators to help make it happen).

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The only thing the club needs is access to a large monitor, which can be found in any of the dorm lounges.
