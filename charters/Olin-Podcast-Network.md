# Olin Podcast Network
Last updated April 22, 2019

## Purpose
Create a platform for teaching, learning, making, and collaborating on podcasts and live radio at Olin.

## Membership
Anyone can join, as long as they follow our code of conduct. We will hold meetings periodically depending on demand, and anyone who follows the code of conduct is welcome, but you can be a member without attending meetings.

## Officers and Roles
We are a decentralized collective. The point person and budget tracker will be self-selected volunteers, who may be the same person. The budget tracker must be spending trained. They will be listed in this document. The point person is responsible for updating the website, and can share this responsibility with others.

- Current point person for questions: [Bennett Taylor](mailto:btaylor@olin.edu)
- Current budget tracker: [Arwen Sadler](mailto:asadler@olin.edu)

## Transition Protocol
The current point person and budget trackers are consensus-based and can be changed at any time, but should be changed approximately once per year. The current point person must have access to the websiteâ€™s admin panel, and must share it with the next point person or transfer access.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Spaces
The budget tracker will draw up a budget, which must contain all purchases. Funding will be spent on radio supplies (e.g. audio cables and editing software), printing, travel, conference fees, and food for meetings if needed in the future. Any member who is spending may submit a purchase request with prior agreement from the budget tracker, but it is recommended that the budget tracker make most or all purchase requests for the sake of organization. Funding may also cover a domain name to host our content.

## Events and Activities
We will produce and broadcast podcast pieces and provide resources to other students who wish to do so.

## Amendment procedure
Any change in leadership or other amendments to the charter must be consensus-based and must be initiated by a request for comment. If a consensus is not reached, decisions must be made by an open majority-vote. Once any changes have been made, the new charter must be pushed to GitHub immediately.

## Code of Conduct
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our club a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. That means:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Taking action whenever these principles are not being followed
