# Olin Aquaponics
*Last modified 2016-25-16*

## Purpose

Olin Aquaponics designs, builds, and maintains aquaculture systems, capable of raising marine life and growing edible plants with minimal waste and energy input, to build awareness of and contribute to environmental sustainability. As part of our goal, we learn, teach, and spread knowledge about sustainable, local food growing.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone. Members are encouraged to attend weekly meetings for system planning, building, and maintenance, participate in occasional trips to buy supplies, and volunteer for the local sustainability community.

## Officers and Roles

The only official role of Olin Aquaponics is that of co-leader. Co-leaders are responsible for the club operations including scheduling, budgeting, purchasing, and outreach. Co-leaders offically have final say in the club's direction, but  ought to give deference to member proposals and initiative, delegating initiatives and responsibilities to enthusiastic and engaged members.

A member's role and involvement grows by taking initiative and being present. Any member who would like to take ownership of any initiative within reason, such as liasing with a club partner, designing or building a system or subsystem, or taking part in system maintenance, should recieve co-leader support. Taking initiative increases the member's role in the direction of the club.

## Transition Protocol

In March/ April, new club leaders will be selected for the following year. Existing co-leaders select new co-leaders from among the active members with an eye towards those most capable of leading this club. Ideally, the co-leaders are from a mix of class-years so that each successive year always includes at least one experienced leader.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Aquaponics, as a small project team, requires significant materials, space, and workshop access. Materials required are quite diverse, ranging from ecological, such as plant supplements, to mechanical, such as pipeline, to electrical, such as lighting and microcontrollers. Currently, the club uses the Library workroom as a design and construction working space, and obtains primary funding through purchase reimbursement by CCO. Budgeting and reimbursement pre-approval are, by default, done by the club co-leaders.

## Events and Activities

Aquaponics holds weekly meetings for system design and building work on the system. Special events, such as shopping trips for system supplies and volunteering at sustainable communities will occur occasionally.

We also aim to have occasional campus-wide events such as a Pesto-Bar (potentially others, depending on what we grow), where the college can come to enjoy the fresh plants we have grown. We may potentially coordinate with other organizations to broaden the scope and reach of these events.

## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure.  Anyone who wants to participate in discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.
