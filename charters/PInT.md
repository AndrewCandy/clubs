# Public Interest Tech (PInT)
*Last modified 2018-08-28*

## Purpose

PInT is a new student-led group on campus working to create and support ways for the Olin community to translate their skills into addressing the wider world's complex issues. Part of this initiative means starting events and conversations about engineering, policy, society, and our responsibility as engineers. Another part of this initiative is developing multiple avenues for students to get involved in. This includes pro-bono consulting work for non-profits, integrating ethics exercises and real-life scenarios into the curriculum, and student-led activism and art.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone. Babson and Wellesley students are welcome!


## Officers and Roles

Officers: Emma Pan, Shreya Chowdhary, Sam Daitzman, Arwen Sadler
Members: General members of the team who participate in activities and helps shape/define what the club looks like.

## Transition Protocol

There must be a consensus-based process at the end of the year to elect at least 2 officers.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Our team space will be in the third floor endcap of the Academic Center, where Scott Hersey has been experimenting with educational spaces. We have obtained his permission to cohabitate. Our purchases will most likely be food and travel expenses, for bringing speakers to campus and hosting events. 

## Events and Activities

Weekly Meeting- a weekly gathering to discuss and work on team projects and plans.
PITea- a regular invitation to the greater Olin community to share what we’re doing and have general discussions about related subjects, like the news, our role as engineers, etc.
Alumni Weekend Speaker Panel- an opportunity for students and alumni to discuss their experiences and interests in relation to public interest tech.
PInT Parties- themed events we will hopefully be organizing throughout the year. Example: the library speaker and student engagement event we held last Spring.

## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure. Anyone who wants to participate in discussions surrounding those changes will be welcome.

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement
It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this team, that students' learning and developmental needs be addressed, and that the diversity that students bring to this team be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

It is the team’s intent to engage with projects, materials, and opportunities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.

All suggestions by team members, co-designers, other students, and all stakeholders are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know how we can improve the effectiveness of the team for you or for other students or student groups. 

The members of the team are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something is said that makes you uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. We commit to listening with an open mind and to changing our behavior and culture to actively include everyone.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our team a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. That means:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the world
- Showing empathy towards other community members and the world
- Taking action whenever these principles are not being followed
