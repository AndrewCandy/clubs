# Climbing Club

*Last modified 2014-09-06*

## Purpose
The goal of the Climbing club is to go promote and increase accessibility to rock climbing for students. We would like to have climbing events every week.

## Membership
Anyone of any skill is allowed to join. All members of Olin are allowed and encouraged to participate. We will be sending out emails on the climbing list.

## Officers and Roles
The Top Climber is the head of the climbing club. He/she manages the mailing list, has the final decision on club decisions, and may appoint a subcommittee to help out.

## Transition Protocol:

In the month of April, the Top Climber must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new Chief Cleaner will inform the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair that the transition has occurred.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We go out of Olin to climb, so we shouldn't need spaces inside Olin. We would like some money to purchase climbing equipment that students can borrow and use. Hopefully, we could store it in the outing club storage.

## Events and Activities
We will go climbing at least once a week. We will get food afterwards as well possibly.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the Director of Clubs and Organizations.
