# BCO (BOW Climbing Organization)

## Purpose
Climbing fun for everyone! Our team will be founded on several key tenets: 

1. Diversity - BOW, All Skill Levels, All Backgrounds
2. Consistency - practicing on a weekly basis
3. Lowering the Barrier of Entry for Beginners
  a. Free Passes to Start
  b. Helping Fund and Kickstart a Climbing Career
4. Fueling the Competitive Fire for Aspiring Climbers 
  a. Focuses Strength and Skill Training
  b. Internal competitions with prizes for participants which will create a goal for everyone to strive towards
  c. Collegiate competitions to represent the BOW team externally

## Membership 
Every member should commit to 1-2 off campus practices at the gym and an on campus workout each week. 

Tryouts (see Events and Activities for more details) will be held each semester, to gauge everyone's climbing abilities.  The team will be broken down into at least 2 categories: recreational and competitive.  

Recreational will spend most time on the rocks, just trying to complete more difficult routes with the help from more seasoned team members.   

Competitive will focus on strength and skill training; their internal fire is fueled by the prospect of representing the BOW climbing team at external competitions.

## Officers and Roles
Our OPEN President will be the final decision maker in all matters.  This individual will have an inner-circle of fellow leaders who will plan ad-hoc meetings.  We anticipate a majority of the work in 1) the organization of tryouts 2) structuring practices to match the skill levels and interests of the members 3) setting up internal competitions 4) managing transportation 5) managing funding 6) planning for external competitions.

Selected more experienced members will act as mentors to the beginners. Their responsibilities range from giving climbing technique seminars, to just giving simple advice on climbing routes. 

## Transition Protocol
In the month of December, the OPEN President must designate a successor, with nominations from other members, who will take over immediately until the next transition period. This internal transition will help for the new successor to learn the ropes, while the old successor is still there.  At the end of the spring semester, the new OPEN President will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has officially occurred.

## Events and Activities
For each of these events and activities, having a dedicated committee to their planning and execution will be crucial for their success. So, assume that "Tryouts" will have its own "Tryouts committee," for example.

  - at the beginning each semester
  - to gauge the skill level of each member
  - possible tool for narrowing down the team in case more than 25 people try out
  - help introduce newbies to climbing and get them excited
- Internal Competitions
  - happens once or twice a semester in order to help motivate the team and create a goal for everyone to work towards
  - have prizes for the participants
