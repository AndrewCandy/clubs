# Art with Heart
*Last modified 2014-09-08*

## Membership

We put on performing art shows and hold visual art galleries (with silent auctions) wherein all the proceeds go to some form of charity or community betterment. All artwork is produced by students and the club will decide together on where to send the money after a show.

## Officers

We need as many artists as possible and I will need a vice president to help me run things. Members should commit to two meetings a month, with optional volunteer service opportunities and more meetings immediately preceding a show.

## Transition Protocol

I need a vice president to work with me; we also need a treasurer, box office point-man, and secretary. Treasurer and secretary are self-explanatory; box office point-man will be in charge of making sure people can buy tickets either before the show, at the show, or both. We also need a stage manager, preferably with some experience stage managing.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Upon reaching the end of a semester after which I or the vice president will be unavailable to run the club, a successor must be voted on by the club and appointed to the appropriate position. Other officers can be replaced at other times, based on need.

## Events and Activities

We need a space to meet and plan our shows, and we need a space to rehearse/put on those shows. We need to advertise (anyone have connections?) and it would be great to have some art supplies that our members can use for their pieces. Priority for use of those supplies would go to club events, though (namely, doing a community service project that involved using art supplies).

We do community service, plus our wonderful bi-annual shows, and we always have a celebratory meeting with sweets and happiness after a show!

## Amendment Procedures
If someone wants to change something about the club, they should let me or the vice-president know so that time can be set aside in the next meeting for the issue to be discussed. *There must be a valid reason for a change to be made.* Once the club has discussed the proposed change, everyone in attendance will vote on whether or not to implement it.
