# Accessibility Alliance
*Last modified 8 Sep 2017*
_**Note: Charlie wrote this and doesn't really know what she's doing, so suggestions are appreciated**_

## Purpose
Wow accessibility at Olin needs a revamp, and badly. Students in wheelchairs come here, get excited, and then realize this campus is terrible for their needs! Which not only sucks, but means it's almost certainly awful for the needs of students already on campus! It's finally time to do something about it.

Speaking of DO SOMETHING, what happened to Do Something time at Olin (you know, how now one has class after 3:10 on Fridays)? What if we used that time to improve the quality of life for everyone on campus? And by "what if" I mean LET'S DO IT!! Woo!!

Conversations and preliminary resources available in the room of Charlie Weiss, EH2W, first door on your left.

## Membership
There will be a mailing list, but anyone with a true spirit may join. However, there are some good things to keep in mind:

* At this point, this is new, and we will probably mess up a lot
* But you should also do your best to listen to the needs of others
* And then accomodate them
* If you feel sketch about something, ask about it (CharlieW volunteers as tribute)
* People usually want to help! If they can't, don't be rude-- they definitely have already something on their plate
* If you have a good idea, tell the club! Or a stupid idea! Any idea has potential! (except the ones that don't)

As an extra note, I have no idea what I'm doing. Just to be clear. I'm going off my own experience and compassion for human beings, so if I (or you!) mess up, please follow the "feedback and forgive" mentality. And also, one more rule:

* Have fun!

## Officers and Roles
Prime Minister of Accessibility: The person who organizes events and money and things, and is head boss kind of. Currently Charlie Weiss.
Other roles as requested.

## Transition Protocol
Prime Minister or club members will choose a new leader.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
Materials:
* Charliew's room, if you follow its rules
* Adva Waranyuwat (probably, she tends to care about accessibility, being the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and all)

To-be-purchased:
* So many things

Space reqs:
* Anywhere that needs improvement

## Events and Activities
Boy do I have a lot of ideas! Including, but not necessarily limited to or actually including:

* Easier reporting of broken elevators or inaccessible places
* Update the freaking elevator inspections (they're up to date, the papers just aren't there and it's been pissing me off for ages)
* Club volunteers to do stress-relieving services for others in times of need (laundry, making a bed, grocery shopping)
* Weighted blanket making
* Stitch and bitch (dunno if anyone else is keeping this up, but I love it)
* Club funding to pay for transporation to far away appointments
* Written guides on how to effectively navigate the medical world as a dumb fake adult
* Conversations about disability at Olin and in general (including invisibile illnesses, respect, weird social dynamics, etc.)
* Conversations about people's preferred labels
* Conversations about Emotional Support Animals (vs. pets, for example)
* Conversations about medical singles and opinions on medical single suite (I'll come clean, I think it's a terrible, TERRIBLE idea)
* Maybe some other things

## Amendment Procedure
Just talk to the PM.
