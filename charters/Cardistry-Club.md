# Cardistry Club
*Last modified 2014-09-08*

## Purpose
Teach cool card moves and/or cool magic tricks

## Membership 
Anyone. If you think you can't do a shuffle or a card spring, chances are you probably can (with practice).	

## Officers and Roles
The head of Card Sharks is known as The Master and will be addressed as such. He/she will be in charge of ordering cards for all, teaching tricks/moves, and maybe even organize informal performance events.	

## Transition Protocol
New Master can be appointed at end of semester/month if current Master is unable to continue.	

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Bricks of cards will be purchased and stored, and each member will receive a deck of standard Bicycle cards to use until they are no longer usable (judged by The Master). 

Meetings will be held in one of room 128, room 130, or the West Hall 1st Floor Lounge 

## Events and Activities
Hopefully get a gathering where members can perform small card tricks. Ideally an alliance with the Cheese Club would be nice.	

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to the charter may be proposed at any time during the semester, but not during summer or winter break. The revision must be sent to the mailing list and if there are no objections to the revision within two weeks, the revision will be sent to SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.
