_**Note: Charlie wrote this and doesn't really know what she's doing, so suggestions are appreciated**_

## Purpose
Adventure is out there! If you agree, join. We're here to invite, unite, and represent all adventurers of Olin. This club is known to host the annual Adventure Club Scavenger Hunt, and this year we're introducing some cool ways to document your adventures. There will be a communal journal and (should funding grant it) a polaroid camera for checkout, which have the handy ability to document cool things "off the grid". Mystery's half the fun.

Adventure items available in the room of Charlie Weiss, EH2W, first door on your left.

## Membership
There is a mailing list, but anyone with a true adventurous spirit may join. However, there are some good adventure rules to follow. MIT's Hacker Code of Ethics is a good reference if you know where to find it, and it goes basically as follows:

* Be safe
* Don't damage anything or anyone, be it physically, mentally, or emotionally
* Be subtle; leave no evidence that you were there.
* Leave things better than you found them.
* Don't steal.
* Never drink and adventure
* Never adventure alone.
* Know your limits and don't be stupid.
* Learn how to not get caught; but if you do, accept it and cooperate.
* Be inclusive-- Share your knowledge and experience.
* Have common sense.

As an extra note, some people liken being exclusive to being cool, and intentionally shroud themselves in mystery. Sure, there are lots of good reasons to keep an adventure on the down low (there's danger in numbers, secrets are fun, it takes awhile to build trust in people, etc.), but the true masters of secret-keeping are the ones no one even suspects. Be subtle. Also, sharing is caring, something something, do it for friendship, something something, don't die alone. And also, one more rule:

* Have fun!
