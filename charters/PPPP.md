# Pretentious Podcasts and Painting with Parmesan (Cheese Club 2.0)

## Purpose:
	To unite the artists (and not artists) - the talented, the less talented, and the not-so talented - together on Wednesday evenings to listen to some highly intellectual podcasts while expressing their inner most feelings about the fine quality parmesan cheese.

## Membership:
	Anyone is welcome to come at any time! We will be holding weekly meetings for anyone. If you canâ€™t make a meeting, no worries. 

## Officers and Roles:
	This an anarchist group that does not believe in a central government. Thus there will be no leaders. However, we will have two organizers that facilitate the meetings. Every year, two volunteers will become organizers (or more if more want to be!)

## Transition Protocol:
	At the end of the year, we will undergo a ceremony in which the Central Paintbrushes will be passed down to the whoever volunteers to be an organizer. Their duties will include deciding on meeting times, preparing the supplies, and recruiting members.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Spaces:
	We do request money in order to buy some painting supplies when we run out. We do have some painting supplies from the art closet from East Hall, so it would not be a huge expense. We also humbly request to have some money to purchase cheese every week (bringing back the cheese club). That way we can entice people to join us.

## Events and Activities:
	Every week, we will invite everyone to come together and paint. We will offer the paint supplies and cheese. Someone will offer up a podcast that we can listen to, and every week will have a different theme (i.e. paint something that reminds you of your favorite communist leader, paint something inspired by the taste parmesan, etc.). Individuals are welcomed to follow the theme, or can ignore it if they want to. 

## Amendment Procedure:
	If members of the community are unhappy about certain aspects of the club, then there will be a meeting with all members to see if a portion of the club should be amended. There will be a community voting in order to see whether change should be made. In case of a draw, one organizer will remove their vote in order to overthrow the draw.
