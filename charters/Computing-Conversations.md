# Computing Conversations
## Purpose
The purpose of Computing Conversations is to foster a friendly computing community at Olin by providing a forum for weekly discussion of interesting computing topics. These conversations will allow students to learn from each other - allowing peer to peer mentorship and friendships. This is designed to be a helpful resource for students of all backgrounds, majors, and experience levels.
## Membership
There's no hard commitment for membership - students are expected to attend based on personal interest since the topic changes every week. We expect to mostly see students and occasionally faculty members. New members are welcome throughout the year. There should be at least one facilitator at each conversation.
## Officers and Roles
Facilitators (1-3 people): Have a general idea of what's going on in the club, have a few points of things to discuss that week (can help spark discussion if needed), and responsible for sending icals/getting snacks.
Facilitators also are responsible for getting feedback from members on how the conversation went, managing amendments, and club logistics.
Facilitators will brainstorm a list of potential topics at the beginning of the semester, manage the mailing list, and will always be welcome to topic suggestions from anyone. Facilitators will also provide support for students wanting to give a talk or presentation on a special topic. 
If certain events/activities require more administrative work, the facilitators will ask club members if they want to help.
## Transition Protocol:
If a member is interested in becoming a facilitator, they should talk to the current facilitators.
In the last month of the semester, a couple of facilitators for the next semester should be decided. 
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We definitely want to provide fun snacks to accompany the weekly conversations (we estimate about $20 per week... so, probably $200 for a semester).
We are considering meeting at a variety of places (as long as they're conversation-friendly and/or provide any necessary resources) - such as the MH computer lab or a dorm lounge space. 
## Events and Activities
The highlight of the club is definitely the weekly conversations. We hope to occasionally have faculty guests too (we're considering having a few of the conversations be something like "Meet the computing professor(s)").
Monthly code jams on the nth weekend (n TBA) of the month - specific topics/"code challenges" TBD as a group.
## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be suggested and/or approved at any time. If anyone is interested in an amendment, s/he should talk to the facilitators that semester. Depending on the amendment suggestion, the facilitators will either approve it on the spot or bring it to a vote with the group (process TBD and varies on a case-by-case basis). Any revisions to the charter will be sent to CCO.
