# Chain Mail and a Movie
## Purpose
We will make various chain mail objects, mainly jewelry, and eventually watch movies as we work. The goal is to enjoy a relaxing evening while being creative and producing something of value. We will meet on Friday nights for two to three hours, to relieve the stress of the school week. Most jewelry only takes two to three hours to make. We will have access to steel originally, and then copper and aluminum as our members learn various techniques.
## Membership
Membership is earned by signing up for the club (we need to know how many pliers and links to procure). We will have a sign-up sheet and a mailing list so that the club leader can inform the members of schedule changes or other issues.
## Officers and Roles
The leader of the club will be the Ring Lord. He/she will be in charge of making sure that enough materials are available for the members who will attend the next meeting. She/he will also be in charge of making sure that we have a location to watch our movie and enough seats.  The Ringmaster will be in charge of food and drinks for the movie. Both will be responsible for teaching the members how to make chain mail jewelry.
## Transition Protocol
The new Ring Lord and Ringmaster will be elected by those members who attend the final meeting, and have been members for at least one month. The election will be held in the month of April. Whoever is elected will be given a document describing the responsibilities of the role he/she plays. Then the instructional books will be handed down to the successor.
## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
We will require two pairs of pliers for each member of the club. These can likely be procured from around campus for little or no cost. The metal that we shape into chain mail will have to be purchased monthly as we estimate the requirements of the projects, and the number of people participating. We will make purchases as we go so that we do not overspend. We will need a space with a TV like a student lounge or a classroom.
## Events and Activities
We will have weekly chain-mail making and movie watching sessions with snacks and drinks.
## Amendment Procedure
Any member can propose an amendment. If more than half of the members present that have been to at least one previous meeting vote to pass the amendment, then the motion succeeds.
## Other
Eventually, we would like to get a set of tools that expands beyond basic pliers so that we can make more complicated patterns. We would also like to build an assortment of metals in different gauges and colors so that we can make a wider assortment of items.
